## Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Big Data Streaming Processing

**Project description:** This project aims to design and implement a data intensive software application to acquire, store,
process and visualise analytics from real-time tweets generated across London. The application makes use of common
distributed computing technologies for working with large volumes of data at scale (Apache Kafka, Apache Spark), and web frameworks (Flask, JavaScript) for the visualisation of the data. The project also makes use of Containerisation/Docker to aid development and deployment.

### 1. Project Outline

The development of an end to end soultion comprised of:

1. Scalable data pipelines to collect and store real time tweets across London, utilising Apache Kafka streams
2. Scalable processing of the data collected in real time including key metrics and a sentiment analysis of each tweet collected, utilising Apache Spark Pyspark data processing
3. A web front end to display the results, utilising Flask and JavaScript libraries

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
